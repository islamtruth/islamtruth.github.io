<p>As islam is heavily based on the arabic language, which is not widely known
outside of islam countries, I have listed a few of the slang that muslims
would be familiar with. Note that this is just a very small selection of
words, there is a lot more.</p>

    padding-left: 1em !important;
    text-indent: -1em !important;
    margin: 0px !important;
}
</style>

<div class="dictionary is-size-7 has-text-justified">
    <p><strong>Adhan</strong>: The call to prayer which is said in Arabic at the start of the
prayer time interval.</p>

<p><strong>Allah</strong>: The Arabic term for “God.”</p>

<p><strong>As-salaam alaikum</strong>: A common greeting used by Muslims around the world which
means “peace be upon you” in Arabic. The response is wa-alaikum as-salaam, “may
peace be upon you too.”</p>

<p><strong>Dhimmi</strong>: A non-muslim person living in muslim territory that is tolerated
because he/she is paying <em>jizya</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Fasiq</strong>: Someone who violates islamic law. Their testimony in islamic court
is not admissible.</p>

<p><strong>Fatwa</strong>: a religious <em>opinion</em> or <em>ruling</em>. Sometimes used to issue death
rulings to people who oppose Islamic teachings. Sometimes these result in
people having to go into police protection.</p>

<p><strong>Hadith</strong>: Sayings or actions of the Prophet Muhammad that were recorded by
his companions and later collected and preserved for later generations. They
help to elaborate on certain teachings, beliefs, and verses in the Qur’an.
Different sects of Islam differ in which hadiths they find to be <em>authentic</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Hijab</strong>: Headscarf worn by muslim women.</p>

<p><strong>Imam</strong>: The leader of congregational prayer, or a religious leader.</p>

<p><strong>Islam</strong>: The proper name of the religion which, which means <em>submission</em>
or <em>surrender</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Jizya</strong>: A special tax imposed on non-muslims living in muslim territory.</p>

<p><strong>Jinn</strong>: Islamic version of spirits or demons. They appear in the Qur&rsquo;an a
few times.</p>

<p><strong>Kafir</strong>: a non-believer. Also <em>kufr</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Masjid</strong>: The Arabic word for “mosque,” the house of worship. Often women
are not allowed, or have to use different doors, and are not allowed to pray
in the same room as men.</p>

<p><strong>Muhammad</strong>: The final prophet to whom Muslims believe God revealed the
Qur’an.</p>

<p><strong>Muslim</strong>: A person who follows the religion of Islam. It sounds similar to
the word Islam. This is because both of the words come from the same root s-l-m
which means peace. A Muslim is someone who practices Islam.</p>

<p><strong>Prophet</strong>: A person Muslims believe was chosen by God to teach two core
messages: 1) God alone should be worshiped; and 2) people should strive to live
ethically by treating others as they wish to be treated (The Golden Rule.) Adam
is considered to be the first prophet and Muhammad is the last, with many
others in between, 25 of whom are mentioned by name in the Qur’an, including
well-known biblical figures such as Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, Moses, David
and Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>Qur’an</strong>: The Holy Book of Islam, which is believed to be the words of God
that were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The word Qur’an literally means
“the recitation.”</p>

<p><strong>Shaytan</strong>: The Islamic version of satan, a creature believe to exist
(invisibly?) tempting humans to commit <em>sins</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Shirk</strong>: The act of worshipping other gods besides Allah.</p>

<p><strong>Sunnah</strong>: The example or practice of the Prophet Muhammad. Much of what is
known about the Sunnah is from the collection of sayings or reports known as
hadith, or prophetic traditions.</p>

<p><strong>Surah</strong>: A chapter of the Qur’an. There are 114 surahs in the Qur’an.</p>

<p><strong>Taghut</strong>: The enemies of Muhammed: people who believe in gods other than
Allah.</p>

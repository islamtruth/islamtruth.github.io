<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m Mustafa and I&rsquo;m the author behind all of the content (except for the
images and videos) of everything you can see on this website.</p>

<p>I have personally struggled with Islam and not believing. I consider myself an
agnostic, because I have grown up to doubt the things people try to convince me
of.</p>

<p>You can live your live bein na√Øve, or you can wake up and realize the truth,
that people will always try to influence you. In this modern age we are
confronted with adertisments. Governments have (in the past and to some extent,
today) created propaganda to try to influence people to be obedient. In the
same spirit, religions try to convince us &ndash; to try to get us to follow them.</p>

<p>Why is it that everyone wants us? In the end, it is all about power.  Companies
have the most transparent motives, as they want us to buy their products. They
want us to give out money to them. Governments need the support of their
people, especially during times of war.  And as the power of a religion is
measures in the number and piety of it&rsquo;s followers, gaining new people is
essential. In any case, it&rsquo;s always about power.</p>

<p>Survival in this age is all about being intelligent and having a sharp mind to
recognize these things. Being sceptic of the things people tell you, and
learning to recognize what their true intentions are. Just as the Romans have
adapted Christianity to strengthen their Empire, so is Islam being used to
gain power to the Arabs.</p>
